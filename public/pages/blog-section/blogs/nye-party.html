                <p id="paragraph-1"> As 2024 draws to a close, New Year’s Eve parties are all about ringing in 2025 with
                    laughter, questionable decisions, and memories that’ll make you cringe and crack up in equal
                    measure. And what better way to spice up the night than with some epic drinking games? Whether
                    you’re vibing with a new group of mates or getting lit with your day ones, these games guarantee to
                    turn the party into a night to remember (or not, depending on how much you drink LOL!).</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you’re hosting or attending, Overexposed has the perfect lineup of games, features, and
                    icebreakers to ensure your NYE party goes off. Let’s get into how to keep the good vibes rolling all
                    night long.</p>

                <br>

                <h2 id="paragraph-2">Kick Off the Night With Fun, Easy-To-Play Games</h2>
                <p>The early hours of any party can be a bit… awkward. Some people are still warming up, others are
                    glued to their phones pretending not to feel shy, and the snacks are disappearing faster than
                    expected. This is where Overexposed’s <a
                    href="https://overexposed.app/never-have-i-ever-settings">Never Have I Ever</a> game mode comes in handy. It’s a classic
                    icebreaker but with an edgier twist.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Why it works: Everyone has stories to tell (or hide), and this game pulls them out in the most
                    unexpected ways. Start with light prompts like “Never have I ever kissed someone at a New Year’s Eve
                    party” and gradually ramp up to the spicier ones. The goal is to loosen up the group and get
                    everyone laughing. Let’s say you’re the only one in the group who has done the prompt, then you’ll
                    have to spin the wheel and accept the punishment it lands on.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Fun tip: Pair this with our “Odd Man Out” Drinking Wheel feature, where the consequences get
                    dictated by chance. Will you take 2 sips, down your drink, or face the spicy shot? (Spoiler: that
                    hot sauce will humble you quickly).
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2 id="paragraph-3">Games to Make the Countdown to Midnight Even More Exciting</h2>
                <p>By now, the drinks are flowing, the playlist is at its peak, and the awkward vibes are gone. This is
                    the perfect time to take things up a notch with our <a href="https://overexposed.app/most-likely-to-settings">Most Likely To</a> game.</p>
                <br>
                <p>How to play: One person reads a prompt like “Who’s most likely to text their ex after midnight?” and
                    the group debates who fits the description. Things can get heated, hilarious, or downright exposing.
                    It’s the perfect mix of fun and drama. Who knows… you may even get to know your friends better!</p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Fun tip: Again, add Overexposed’s Drinking Wheel feature to make the game more interesting. If the
                    group has voted you to be the most likely to do something read out loud from the prompt, then you
                    must spin the wheel and take the punishment! For your sake, let’s hope it doesn’t land on “Down It”!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>For parties with a mix of drinkers and non-drinkers, swap the drinks for harmless dares or funny
                    challenges, so everyone stays involved.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h2 id="paragraph-4">Inclusive Variations for Non-Drinkers and Light Drinkers</h2>
                <p>Not everyone wants to wake up on January 1st regretting their life choices, and that’s fine. Most
                    Overexposed games can easily be tweaked for sober fun. For example:</p>
                <br>
                <p>In <a href="https://overexposed.app/paranoia-settings">Paranoia</a>, someone in the group has to pick a prompt card and not show anyone. After reading the
                    card they must decide who best fits the prompt. If the chosen person wants to find out what the
                    prompt is, then they must either flip the coin (which doesn’t have to involve drinking) or spin the
                    drinking wheel and take a forfeit. So it could be something like heads to find out the prompt or
                    tails to stay paranoid. Instead of drinking shots, try push-ups, singing a song, or wearing a silly
                    hat for the next round. Be creative with it! </p>
                <br>
                <p>The classic <a href="https://overexposed.app/truth-or-dare-settings">Truth or Dare</a> game always works as an alternative…no alcohol required. Keep the prompts
                    spicy enough to stay entertaining but not so outrageous that people wish they stayed home.</p>
                <br>

                <h2 id="paragraph-5">Post-Midnight Games to Keep the Energy Going</h2>
                <p>Once the fireworks are over, the snacks are demolished, and someone’s mumbling the wrong lyrics to
                    “Auld Lang Syne,” it’s the perfect time to see who’s got the stamina to carry the party into the wee
                    hours. These post-midnight games are designed to keep the vibes alive, the energy high, and the
                    laughs flowing.</p>
                <h3 id="paragraph-5a">1. Overexposed’s Mild Mischief Food-Eating Contests (With a Twist)</h3>
                <p>Bring out Overexposed’s <a href="https://overexposed.app/most-likely-to-settings">Most Likely To</a> cards from the “Mild Mischief” category and you’ll find
                    prompts like: “Who’s most likely to win a food-eating contest?” You can even up the ante by
                    challenging your group to speed-eat leftover pizza, crisps, or chocolate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>How to Play:</p>
                <div class="indented">
                    <p>&#8226; Nominate three “contestants” based on the group vote for the card.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&#8226; Set a timer (two minutes is plenty!) and see who can devour the most.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&#8226; Forfeit Idea: The loser has to spin the Drinking Wheel or take on a spicy shot!</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>This twist guarantees laughs, chaotic crumbs everywhere, and a bit of competitive spirit to push
                    through the midnight munchies.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="paragraph-5b">2. Waterfall Chaos (Drinking Wheel Edition)</h3>
                <p>For those brave enough, Overexposed’s Drinking Wheel feature is your secret weapon for post-midnight
                    antics. Spin the wheel, and if it lands on Waterfall, the group is in for a wild ride.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="indented">
                    <p>&#8226; The player who spun starts drinking.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&#8226; Everyone else follows in sequence, but no one can stop drinking until the person before
                        them has.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>It’s chaotic, hilarious, and almost guarantees someone’s “I’m done” moment. Plus, it’s a great way to
                    bring everyone back together if smaller groups have started to form.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="paragraph-5c">3. Paranoia Confessions (Truth Bombs Edition)</h3>
                <p>Post-midnight is prime time for spilling tea. Whip out Overexposed’s <a href="https://overexposed.app/paranoia-settings">Paranoia</a> cards and start some
                    playful drama. Each player draws a card, reads the prompt to themselves in their heads (e.g., “Who
                    would ghost someone they liked?”), and they name their pick out loud.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Why it’s Perfect:</p>
                <div class="indented">
                    <p>&#8226; Adds just the right amount of mystery and cheeky tension.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&#8226; Bonus: Tie in the Lucky Coin Flip to determine if the prompt is revealed. Heads = prompt
                        is read out loud; tails = they stay paranoid.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>This game is a recipe for midnight giggles, side-eyes, and a whole lot of “Wait, WHAT?”. </p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="paragraph-5d">4. Late Night Power Rankings (Group Roast Edition)</h3>
                <p>Combine <a href="https://overexposed.app/most-likely-to-settings">Most Likely To</a> and <a href="https://overexposed.app/never-have-i-ever-settings">Never Have I Ever</a> for the ultimate end-of-night roast session. Read out
                    cards like “Who’s most likely to cancel plans for a nap?” or “Never have I ever texted my ex this
                    year,” and have the group vote on a “winner”.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="indented">
                    <p>&#8226; Players take turns justifying their rankings, sparking funny debates.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&#8226; The “winner” of each round has to spin the Drinking Wheel or accept a dare.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <P>By now, people are either embracing the roast vibes or pretending to be asleep on the sofa…it’s all
                    part of the fun.</P>
                <br>
                <h2 id="paragraph-6">Tips to Make the Games Even Better</h2>
                <p>No matter how legendary your drinking games are, the vibes will fall flat if the party isn’t set up
                    for success. Here are some quick tips:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="indented">
                    <p>&#8226; Get the right mix of people. Not every game works with every group. Know your audience,
                        and don’t force shy people into intense rounds of Truth or Dare.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&#8226; Set up a comfortable space. A cramped living room with no seating kills the mood faster
                        than bad Wi-Fi.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>&#8226; Keep the drinks flowing…but responsibly. Always have non-alcoholic options for pacing
                        yourself and making sure no one feels left out.
                    </p>
